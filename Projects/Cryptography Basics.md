**Task 2 - Importance of Cryptogrpahy**

*Q: What is the standard required for handling credit card information?*

A: PCI DSS or  the Payment Card Industry Digital Security Standard, is an information security standard administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. PCI DSS is used to handle branded credit cards.

**Task 3 - Plaintext to Ciphertext**

*Q: What do you call the encrypted plaintext?*

A: We call this ciphertext. The only information in an ideal world you should be able to get from a ciphertext is its approximate size.

*Q2: What do you call the process that returns the plaintext?*

A: This process is called decryption. This is the opposite of encryption, which makes the plaintext unreadable.

**Task 4 - Historical Ciphers**

*Q: Knowing that **XRPCTCRGNEI** was encrypted using Caesar Cipher, what is the original text?*

A: **ICANENCRYPT** Is the message once decrypted. This can be done by brute forcing the encryption through websites online. The shift used is backwards 11, or 15 forwards.

**Task 5 - Types of Encryption**

*Q: Should you trust DES(Yea/Nay)?*

A: Nay. The primary reason DES should not be trusted is that it is quite dated, and can easily be cracked with modern technology. In fact 3DES, which is DES applied 3 times over, was deemed end of life in 2019 and should now be replaced by AES.

*Q2: When was AES adopted as an encryption standard?*

A: 2001. AES us a symmetric block encryption algorithm and contains various key sizes

**Task 6 - Basic Math**

*Q: What's 1001 ⊕ 1010?*

A: 0011 is our answer. In this example, we are using the "⊕" binary operation, which is short for XOR, or Exclusive Or. If the binary digit in the bit is the same, XOR will return a 0. If it is different at the same position, it will return a 1. Thus, our new 4 bits of data is **0011**.

*Q2: What's 118613842 % 9091?*

A: The answer is **3565**. The "%" represents the modulo operation, which is essentially the remainder if dividing those two numbers. Modulo can also be written as mod.

*Q: What's 60 % 12?*

A: This one is a lot easier to write out due to smaller numbers. The answer is **0**. This is due to the fact that 60 divides into 12 evenly, as 60/12 (divided by) is 5. Thus we have no remainder, making 60 mod 12 = 0.
