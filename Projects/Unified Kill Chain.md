**Task 2 - What is a "Kill Chain"**

*Q1: Where does the term "Kill Chain" originate from? For this answer, you must fill in the blank!: The _______*

A: The term "Kill Chain" originates from the **Military**.

**Task 3 - What is "Threat Modelling"**

*Q1: What is the technical term for a piece of software or hardware in IT (Information Technology)?*

A: The technical term for a piece of software or hardware in IT is referring to an **Asset**.

**Task 4 - Introducing the Unified Kill Chain**

*Q1: In what year was the Unified Kill Chain framework released?*

A: The modern version of the Unified Kill Chain (UKC) framework was released in the year **2017**.

*Q2: According to the Unified Kill Chain, how many phases are there to an attack?*

A: According to the UKC, there are **18** different phases in an attack.

*Q3: What is the name of the attack phase where an attacker employs techniques to evade detection?*

A: **Defense Evasion** is the name of the attack phase where an attacker employs and utilizes various techniques to avoid or evade detection.

*Q4: What is the name of the attack phase where an attacker employs techniques to remove data from a network?*

A: The attack phase where an attacker utilizes techniques to remove data from a network is referred to as **Exfiltration**.

*Q5: What is the name of the attack phase where an attacker achieves their objectives?*

A: The **Objectives** phase of the UKC is where an attacker has achieved their objective(s).

**Task 5 - Phase: In (Initial Foothold)**

*Q1: What is an example of a tactic to gain a foothold using emails?*

A: A method known as **Phishing** is a common tactic used to gain a foothold within a network using emails.

*Q2: Impersonating an employee to request a password reset is a form of what?*

A: The act of impersonating an employee to request a password reset is a form of **Social Engineering**.

*Q3: An adversary setting up the Command & Control server infrastructure is what phase of the UKC?*

A: An adversary setting up the C2 server infrastructure is known as the **Weaponization** phase of the Unified Kill Chain.

*Q4: Exploiting a vulnerability present on a system is what phase of the UKC?*

A: The **Exploitation** phase of the UKC is when the exploitation of a vulnerability present on a system occurs.

*Q5: Moving from one system to another is an example of?*

A: Moving from one system to another once a foothold is gained is an example of **Pivoting**.

*Q6: Leaving behind a malicious service that allows the adversary to log back into the target is what?*

A: Leaving behind a malicious service (backdoor) is known as a **Persistence** technique.

**Task 6 - Phase: Through (Network Propagation)**

*Q1: As a SOC analyst, you pick up numerous alerts pointing to failed login attempts from an administrator account. What stage of the kill chain would an attacker be seeking to achieve?*

A:  The attack would be seeking to achieve a **Privilege Escalation**, since the account they are trying to log in to is an administrator.

*Q2: Mimikatz, a known post-exploitation tool, was recently detected running on the IT Manager's computer. Security logs show that Mimikatz attempted to access memory spaces typically used by Windows to store user authentication secrets. Considering the usual capabilities and purpose of Mimikatz, what is the primary objective of this tool in such an attack scenario?*

A: The objective that is most likely given the scenario is a **Credential Dump** utilizing Mimikatz.

**Task 7 - Phase: Out (Action on Objectives)**

*Q1: While monitoring the network as a SOC analyst, you realize that there is a spike in the network activity, and all the traffic is outbound to an unknown IP address. What stage could describe this activity?*

A: This describes the **Exfiltration** stage of the UKC quite accurately, as there will be a lot of outbound traffic to unknown IP addresses trying to obtain classified information.

*Q2: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has been released to the public by an adversary, and your organization is facing scrutiny for the breach. What part of the CIA triad would be affected by this action?*

A: The **Confidentiality** of the your organization would be heavily affected, given that PII was leaked to the public by an adversary.
