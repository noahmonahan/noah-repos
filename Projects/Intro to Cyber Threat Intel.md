A: If an adversary has obtained access to a network and is extracting data, they are on the final phase of the kill chain: **Actions on Objectives**.

**Task 5 - Practical Analysis**

*Q1: What was the source email address?*

A: Looking at the static site, we see a simulated SIEM platform. The event on September 10th, 200 at 08:40:20:091 shows the malicious email: **vipivillain@badbank.com**.

*Q2: What was the name of the file downloaded?*

A: As seen in the image above in the previous question, the event at the time Sept 10th 2020, 08:41:35:123 shows that a file download was initiated with the name **flbpfuh.exe**.

*Q3: After building the threat profile, what message do you receive?*

A: Fill in the infographic and prompts upon clicking the buttons. This will check your knowledge on reading SIEM event logs. 

The Victim Email recipient is **John Doe**.
The User Victim Logged Account is **Administrator**.
The Threat Actor Extraction IP Address is **91.185.23.222**.
The Threat Actor Email Address is **vipivillain@badbank.com**.
The Malware Tool is **flbpfuh.exe**.

Upon feeding the answers into the static site, it should pop up with the flag, and our answer.
