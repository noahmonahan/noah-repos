Task 1 - Web App Testing and Privilege Escalation

Question 1) What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?

Before we begin answering the question, we need to enumerate a little bit, and find out which ports are even vulnerable to attack. We do this through an nmap scan of the target machine.

Here are the results!

Now we know the server is accessible via a few ways. We also know that this server is a web server. This is due to port 80 being open, which is HTTP. You can also see to the right of it it is running Apache httpd 2.4.18 on Ubuntu.

To finally answer the question we need to run a tool called gobuster, and use the dir function. To do this we will run the command seen in the below screenshot, along with the results.

As we can see, we found one directory, /development. This is our answer.

Question 2) What is the username?

We are going to use the old brute force method for this question. To begin, we need to see what we can find in SMB.

To begin this step, we are going to run enum4linux to enumerate for users via SMB.
To do this, we enter this into the terminal: ![[Pasted image 20240911104923.png]]
You will see this as a result: 
![[Pasted image 20240911104951.png]]
We now have two users!

Next, through the directory we found earlier, we can access a backend webpage used for development called /development. Let's navigate there. Let's look at j.txt.

![[Pasted image 20240911105153.png]]
We see this in there... we can assume K is talking about the user we found earlier, Jan. Let's try it out!

Question 3) What is the password?

For this we are going to bruteforce. We are going to use an application called Hydra to do so.
To utilize Hydra, we are going to run the command below.
![[Pasted image 20240911105642.png]]
Replace the IP in the screenshot with your target.
Let it run. It may take a few minutes to complete the brute force attack.
It found the password!
![[Pasted image 20240911111653.png]]
Our Password is Armando!

Question 4) What Service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?
We can now login in via SSH to our target!

Question 5) What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?
Through some digging, we find out that we can make a horizontal privilege change. We find user kay is accessible.

Question 6) What is the final password you obtain?

We need to enumerate a little further now. So, we will move a shell script over we can run called linPEAS. This is done through the following command: 
![[Pasted image 20240911115214.png]]
We now need to quickly mark it as executable.
![[Pasted image 20240911115305.png]]
run it! ./linpeas.sh

We found something! We found a private SSH key we can use to possibly escalate further. 
![[Pasted image 20240911120524.png]]

We have read permissions for that file! Lets read it.
![[Pasted image 20240911120625.png]]
Let's save that real quick with a nano.
We need to make it read-only quickly, since RSA can be picky.
![[Pasted image 20240911120921.png]]
Now, lets use that RSA key.
Crap. its passphrashed. 
![[Pasted image 20240911121046.png]]

We now need to crack it, JOHN
Run the ssh2john.py script.
![[Pasted image 20240911121658.png]]

Its not really in a state we can understand just yet. Lets get it there.
![[Pasted image 20240911121847.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240911122346.png]]
We now have it!
![[Pasted image 20240911122417.png]]
we can now read the file we were after and have successfully escalated!
![[Pasted image 20240911122553.png]]
ALL DONE! Congrats!
